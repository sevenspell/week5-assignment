# week5-assignment - The Day Planner

## Description 

This is a Day Planner that would be useful for people to schedule their daily activities hour by hour. It allows them to save entries individually, and will remain on the page for as long as the day is active or until they clear the entry manually. It also shows by color the current active hour, as well as separating by colors the hours that have passed, and the hours that are coming up.


## Installation

Github cloning, coding done using VS Code app.


## Usage 

Go to Day Planner page (https://sevenspell.github.io/week5-assignment/).

1. Start with an empty Day Planner. It shows the current day and date at the top.

2. Blue boxes are past hours in the planner, while yellow shows the current active hour.

3. Put in some entries according to the time and click on the red save button to the right of each entry. Try refreshing the page and confirm the entries remain.

4. When the day changes ie. clock goes to the next day and date. Current active hour is midnight, and all entries are automatically cleared for the new day. The caveat to this is that entries will not work during hour 0 ie. between 12am and 12:59am. Anytime outside of that will work as expected.

5. Put in new entries for the new day, click on the corresponding save buttons and refresh the page to confirm the entries remain. (blue is for past hours, yellow is for current active hour, and purple is for future hours)

## Credits

I had great guidance from Sandesh who saved me twice when I was stuck in problems I spent days on and couldn't get past. Definitely learnt many new things from this.
